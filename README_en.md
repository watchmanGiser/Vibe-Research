## What it is

Current version: **v1.1.0**. It includes the v1.0.4 baseline and subsequent Issue/PR fixes, with expanded subscription access, a dual-engine experience, an updated interface, and a standalone Mac client.

**[Mac installer and release notes](https://github.com/simonlin1212/Vibe-Research/releases/tag/v1.1.0)** (Apple Silicon / M-series, macOS 13+). Download `VibeResearch-1.1.0-M40-mac-arm64.dmg`, not GitHub's automatically generated Source code archives. Available downloads are listed on the published release page.

Source version **1.1.0**, Mac build **40**. The App is Developer ID-signed and Apple-notarized. Tool calls and restart persistence were verified after copying it from the final DMG; the DMG container is separately signed. Validation on another Mac, Windows, and the complete provider matrix remains outstanding. See the [M40 acceptance record (Chinese)](docs/发布候选与隐私验收_M40_2026-09-07.md). The older M38 candidate is **1.0.4 / build 37** and is not the installer for this release.

Vibe Research is a **local financial research workbench**. On first launch, the user makes one decision: connect an
existing Claude Code / WorkBuddy (CodeBuddy) subscription, complete the product-specific Codex login, or provide a model API. After the connection succeeds, Vibe Research
Agent is off by default for ordinary chat. Enable it when research is needed; no understanding of harnesses or routing modes is required.

Agent mode maintains local context, calls tools, advances tasks, handles failures, and preserves the research
process. A Codex subscription runs through the
[OpenAI Codex Harness](https://developers.openai.com/blog/codex-as-a-platform); a Claude.ai subscription runs through
the local Claude Code Agent; a WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy account runs through Tencent's official CodeBuddy Code CLI. Vibe Research applies the same financial data, research procedures, deterministic
calculations, evidence checks, and compliance boundaries above those runtimes.

The Claude Code and WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy Agents support chat, bounded document tasks, debate, Agent-guided backtesting,
image/table transcription, and the full six-stage A-share research workflow.
During research, their built-in tools are disabled and only five controlled Vibe Research MCP tools are exposed. The runtime is never silently switched to Codex.

The upper-left Agent switch and Settings share the same state. Both subscriptions and APIs support ordinary chat;
verified APIs use direct requests, while other sources retain their subscription or Responses transport without tools.

| Agent mode (enable when needed) | Ordinary chat (default) |
|---|---|
| Maintains context and task state | Retains chat history without starting tool-based research |
| Can call local data, calculation, and research tools | Does not call Agent tools |
| Supports six-stage research, debate, and Agent-guided backtesting | Suited to light chat, translation, and passage location |
| Preserves progress, evidence, reports, and failures | Does not preserve Agent task memory |
| Accepts either a subscription or an API as its reasoning source | Keeps the selected source without Agent tools |

Codex, Claude Code, and WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy subscription runtimes are connected today, with live CLI, version, and login detection.
Subscription adapters reuse the corresponding login. Agent chat supports web search, public page reading, data retrieval, and product tools; six-stage research keeps its stage-specific MCP tools. User settings, automatic memory, and CLI session persistence remain isolated. Qwen Code and DeepSeek CLI remain API paths because they require
their own API key.

## Comparison with the previous public release

The baseline is the [v1.0.4 release](https://github.com/simonlin1212/Vibe-Research/releases/tag/v1.0.4) and [README at that tag](https://github.com/simonlin1212/Vibe-Research/blob/v1.0.4/README.md), checked on September 7, 2026. The right column describes the features and delivery scope of v1.1.0.

| Area | Previous public v1.0.4 | v1.1.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery | Open-source code and a local browser workbench | Retains source setup; adds a standalone Apple Silicon Mac client with bundled runtimes |
| Subscriptions | Codex and Claude Code, alongside API access | Adds WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy, quick connection tests on the home page, and the actual saved source label |
| Home and everyday chat | Already included home Agent chat and research sections | Ordinary chat by default, opt-in Agent; keeps sidebar sections, groups home shortcuts into five categories, and unifies orange light/dark themes |
| Chat tools | Claude subscription chat disabled tools and networking | With Agent enabled: search, public page reading, data, and calculations; background research requires confirmation and replies show actual tool calls |
| Portfolio and watchlist | Symbol entry, local records, and quote refresh | Adds image/table transcription drafts that require review and explicit saving |
| Research experience | Already included six-stage research, evidence validation, a document library, debate, and backtesting | Retains and refines these capabilities, with improved report/source panels, cancellation, refresh recovery, and source binding |
| Setup and engine | Codex 0.149.0; Mac/Linux instructions started backend and UI separately | Engine verified at 0.153.4; source setup/start scripts; Mac client needs no separate Node, Python, or Codex installation |

The Mac app has Developer ID signing, Apple notarization, and a stapled ticket. Its DMG is a signed container holding that app, not a separately notarized DMG. Another clean Mac, physical Windows hardware, and the full provider matrix remain outside current verification; see [boundaries](#current-boundaries).

## Features

| Module | Current capability |
|---|---|
| Home chat | Ordinary chat by default; enable Agent to search the web, read pages, retrieve data, calculate, and inspect research records; background research requires confirmation, and replies show actual tool calls |
| Daily review | Summarises market activity, themes, limit-up drivers, and daily signals |
| Intelligence radar | Translated Investment News headlines, public news, A-share filings, and event probabilities |
| Industry signals | GPU rental rates, monthly industry data, commodities, hiring, and data calendars |
| Sector centre | Reviews sector performance and drills into specific industry themes |
| Company research | Six-stage A-share workflow: profile, financials, consensus, valuation, risk, and report |
| My reports | Stores PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, and CSV locally, with extraction, search, citations, download, and deletion |
| Backtesting | Uses an agent conversation as the only input; asks for missing details, then calls the real backtest tool |
| Bull/bear review | Bull, bear, rebuttal, and neutral-referee stages share the same factual dossier |
| Watchlist and portfolio | Recognises A-share, US, and Hong Kong symbols; local records and quote refresh; image/table drafts require review, form completion, and explicit saving |
| Research records | Stores research, backtest, and debate reports with search, timestamps, expansion, and deletion |
| Connect AI | Connects a subscription or model API; the upper-left and Settings Agent switches stay synchronized and default off |

### Research output is inspectable

A six-stage research run produces:

- `report.md`: the final research report.
- `evidence.json`: evidence used in the run, including source, date, and raw reference.
- `calculations.json`: deterministic inputs, functions, and calculation DAGs.
- `conflicts.json`: disagreements between sources, without silent resolution.
- `manifest.json`: model, version, stages, status, recalled documents, and run metadata.
- `viewer.html`: a browser-readable evidence and report viewer.

If required data is missing, the run becomes `incomplete` or `failed`. It does not fill gaps with stale values or
model guesses.

An active research run can be stopped, and its status remains available after a page refresh. Completed stages are retained.
A stop request is not a confirmation: the page distinguishes a request, confirmed shutdown, and failure to confirm shutdown.
Portfolio imports create drafts without writing to the ledger automatically. Selected image or table contents are sent to the current AI provider; remove unrelated sensitive information before submitting.
Temporary files for the current transcription are removed after success, failure, or cancellation. Keep your original files to verify drafts. This cleanup applies only to local temporary copies, not to content already received by the model provider.

## Quick start

### Standalone Mac client

Download the Mac DMG from the [v1.1.0 Release](https://github.com/simonlin1212/Vibe-Research/releases/tag/v1.1.0), open it, drag the App into Applications, then launch it from there. It supports Apple Silicon Macs running macOS 13 or later and bundles Node, Python, and the Codex engine. The M40 App has passed Developer ID signing, Apple notarization, ticket verification, and local copy-install checks. Validation on another clean Mac remains outstanding. See the [M40 acceptance record](docs/发布候选与隐私验收_M40_2026-09-07.md) (Chinese).

Maintainers can create a local test package using the [Mac build guide](packaging/macos/README.md). Connect your own AI account or API in the app on first launch; browser connection settings are not imported. Replacing the app preserves existing reports and ledger records in `~/.vibe-research-desktop`. The instructions below are for running from source.

### Requirements

| Item | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Operating system | Windows 11, macOS, or Linux; Windows runs natively and does not require WSL |
| Node.js | ≥ 22.18; Node 24 LTS recommended |
| Python | ≥ 3.11; Python 3.12 recommended and currently verified |
| Agent engine | Codex Harness is installed with the product dependencies; the development branch pins version 0.153.4, verified locally; no global Codex install required |
| Model access | Codex / Claude Code / WorkBuddy subscription login, or a model API compatible with the selected execution mode |

> Node must be a build with TypeScript support enabled (the official nodejs.org installers and anything installed via nvm / fnm / Volta are): `node -p process.features.typescript` should print `strip` or `transform`. Some Linux distribution packages ship Node compiled without it; starting the app or running tests then fails with `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION ".ts"` / `ERR_NO_TYPESCRIPT` — switch to an official build. `npm test` runs this check first and prints the same guidance.

### Install dependencies

> These instructions run the product from source. Mac users who prefer direct installation can use the installer above. If you already have a source checkout, back up your data before updating the code and running setup; there is no need to clone again.

Windows (PowerShell or Command Prompt):

```bat
git clone https://github.com/simonlin1212/Vibe-Research.git vibe-research-agent
cd vibe-research-agent
scripts\setup-windows.cmd
scripts\start.cmd
```

`setup-windows.cmd` creates `.venv`, installs Node/Python dependencies, initializes the private product data
directory, and runs diagnostics. `start.cmd` starts the local API and browser UI and opens
`http://127.0.0.1:5930`.

macOS / Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonlin1212/Vibe-Research.git vibe-research-agent
cd vibe-research-agent
scripts/setup
scripts/start
```

`scripts/setup` creates `.venv`, installs the bundled Agent engine and all Node/Python dependencies, initializes the
private data directory, and runs diagnostics. `scripts/start` checks the installation and fixed ports, starts both
services, and opens the browser only after both are healthy. No global Codex install or second terminal is required.

### Connect AI

The home page opens with Agent chat. If no AI is connected, a setup dialog offers one-click testing and saving for
an already signed-in Codex, Claude Code, or WorkBuddy subscription. **Other connection methods** opens Settings
for API configuration and login help. A new connection leaves the Agent off by default; future visits go straight
to chat, and the upper-left label shows the saved source. The dialog can be dismissed to browse features first.
Suggested research questions appear in chat, with existing features grouped into five categories below it.
Enable the Agent for current data and multi-step research. Explicit choices persist across reloads and re-testing the same source.
Subscription chat still starts its original client; response times are not guaranteed.

For ChatGPT subscription access, start the UI, open **Connect AI → Subscription**, and click **Log in to Codex**.
Complete authorization on the official OpenAI page that opens, return to Settings, and click **Test and save**
after the login status turns ready. The product uses its own `.local/codex-home` and never reads or overwrites
`~/.codex`. If the authorization page does not open, return to Settings and click **Log in to Codex** again. If the
local status is still unclear, run `scripts/doctor` (or `scripts\doctor.ps1` on Windows) for an actionable diagnosis.

For Claude.ai subscription access, install and log in to Claude Code. The settings page detects it automatically;
no Claude API key needs to be entered into Vibe Research.

For WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy access, Settings directly detects the official CodeBuddy Code CLI bundled with an installed,
signed-in WorkBuddy desktop app. No second installation or login is required. Users without the desktop app can instead
install Tencent's CLI with `npm install -g @tencent-ai/codebuddy-code` and run `codebuddy` once to sign in. Neither path
requires entering a token or API key into Vibe Research.

For API access, open **Connect AI → API access**, choose a provider, enter the API base URL, model name, and key,
then click **Test and save**. A real model request must succeed before the new configuration is saved and shared
across the product. The same probe records whether the provider supports the verified direct-mode contract.
If asked to reconnect, check whether login is incomplete, expired, or the connection probe failed. Follow the specific error shown; not every connection failure means the subscription has expired.

### Start the browser UI

Run `scripts\start.cmd` on Windows or `scripts/start` on macOS / Linux. Both commands manage the local API and UI
together at [http://127.0.0.1:5930](http://127.0.0.1:5930). On macOS / Linux, use `scripts/start --no-open` to skip
opening the browser automatically; Ctrl+C stops both processes.

Vite proxies `/api/*` locally and adds authentication on the server side. If `VRA_DATA_ROOT` is set, both
processes must use the same value.

### Run one research job from the command line

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
node orchestrator/src/run.ts `
  --symbol 300308 `
  --market SZ `
  --python "$PWD\.venv\Scripts\python.exe"
```

Windows automatically uses the `controlled_mcp` execution layer. The research thread has no shell access and no
workspace write permission; it can only read sanitized run files, call deterministic calculations, and write the
current stage through controlled tools. macOS and Linux keep the existing hook-based execution layer.

macOS / Linux:

```bash
node orchestrator/src/run.ts \
  --symbol 300308 \
  --market SZ \
  --python "$(pwd)/.venv/bin/python" < /dev/null
```

A full run depends on data scope, model response times, and validation retries; it can take tens of minutes or longer, with no fixed duration guaranteed. Progress remains visible, and results are written to
`.local/runs/<run-id>/`. Exit codes: `0` complete, `2` incomplete/stale, and `3` failed.

## How it works

├─ Codex subscription / compatible Responses API → Codex Harness
├─ Claude subscription → Claude Code CLI
├─ WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy → CodeBuddy Code CLI
└─ Ordinary chat with a verified API → direct model request, no Agent tools
```

The project enforces its rules at three levels:

| Layer | Components | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Instruction | `AGENTS.md` + `.agents/skills/` | Defines financial research discipline and procedures |
| Execution | Runtime-specific sandbox / hooks / controlled MCP | Restricts network, file access, data fetching, and output locations by task |
| Orchestration | orchestrator + validator + calc + gate | Enforces stages, citations, deterministic calculations, and compliance |

The project does not modify Codex source code. The Codex checkout is an upstream reference only; the product uses
the official CLI and SDK.

## Model access

The **Connect AI** page asks two separate questions: first where the AI comes from, then whether to use the Agent.
The Agent defaults to off for ordinary chat; enable it in the upper-left corner when research is needed.

- The Agent Runtime manages local context, tool calls, task state, progress, and failure handling. Codex subscriptions use the Codex Harness; Claude subscriptions use the Claude Code Agent; WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy uses the CodeBuddy Code Agent. They are not presented as the same runtime.
- The Claude Code and WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy Agents can run the full six-stage A-share workflow. Each stage uses a separate session with access only to the controlled Vibe Research MCP, and the runtime is never silently switched to Codex.
- The AI source can be a subscription login or the user's Model Provider API. A new source defaults to Agent off; re-testing the same source preserves an explicit choice.
- Direct mode does not run the Agent, call tools, or preserve Agent task memory. Six-stage research, bull/bear debate, and Agent-guided backtesting clearly ask the user to re-enable the Agent instead of silently degrading.
- Codex subscription mode uses the product's own `CODEX_HOME` and never reads or writes the user's `~/.codex`. Claude and CodeBuddy subscription modes reuse their own local login. Ordinary chat disables all tools and MCP; six-stage research disables built-in tools and exposes only the controlled product MCP. User settings and automatic memory remain off. If WorkBuddy bundles an older CLI without a no-session-persistence flag, the entire answer runs under a disposable temporary home that is deleted afterward.
- Both subscription and API configurations must pass a real conversation probe before **Test and save** updates the active configuration.
- In API mode, the key persists in the current browser profile's local `localStorage` so it does not need to be entered again.
  It is not an OS keychain and encryption is not guaranteed, so use it only on a trusted personal computer and clear it after
  use on a shared machine. It is sent to the local backend per request and is not written to the repository, backend
  configuration, run ledger, or logs.

Built-in provider templates: OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Kimi, MiMo, and an unverified `selfhosted` placeholder. The Codex Harness API path supports the Responses
API; the direct channel uses the separately declared and verified protocol in each provider profile. A template's
presence does not mean it passed the compatibility matrix. Ordinary chat does not mark an unverified profile as a verified direct API.

See [docs/model-access.md](docs/model-access.md) and [providers/README.md](providers/README.md).

LAN access is optional and off by default. From the repository root, run `VRA_LAN=1 bash scripts/start`;
in Windows PowerShell, set `$env:VRA_LAN="1"` and run `scripts/start.ps1`. Only the UI is exposed; the backend stays on loopback.
With the backend already running, `VRA_LAN=1 npm run dev --prefix desktop` also starts the UI.
**Trusted LANs only**: this shares a single-user workspace, not separate accounts. Anyone who can reach the port can operate it.
HTTP is unencrypted; API keys and research data may travel in plaintext. Never expose this port publicly or on an untrusted network.
The proxy checks the browser origin before normalizing it. Remote model endpoints still require HTTPS; loopback HTTP is supported.
See [model access and LAN boundaries](docs/model-access.md#3-自托管模型与局域网访问) (Chinese).

## Data and markets

- Current registry: **117 endpoints across 30 layers**, covering CN, US, and HK.
- Data includes quotes, candles, financial statements, consensus, filings, reports, fund flows, positioning,
  options, SEC/FINRA/CBOE, news, macro data, industry thermometers, hiring, restrictions, and data calendars.
- A-share, US, and Hong Kong symbols work in the watchlist, portfolio, document library, and agent conversations.
- **The six-stage company research workflow currently supports A-shares only.** It will not launch an empty
  US or Hong Kong research run without the required data chain.
- Scanned PDFs require OCR. Text PDFs preserve page-level citations.

See [datasources/CATALOG.md](datasources/CATALOG.md) for the endpoint catalog.

## Project structure

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `desktop/` | React + Vite local browser UI |
| `packaging/macos/` | Standalone Mac window, runtime packaging, and signing tools |
| `orchestrator/` | Agent orchestration, validators, API, MCP, chat, document library, and report archive |
| `backtest/` | Deterministic backtest engine and tool entry point |
| `calc/` | Deterministic calculation library |
| `datasources/` | Endpoint registry, catalog, and health checks |
| `.agents/skills/` | Financial research procedures and data tools |
| `providers/` | Provider templates with no secrets |
| `scripts/` | Initialisation and diagnostics |
| `.local/` | Private user data, reports, sessions, and run artifacts; gitignored |

## Security and privacy

- With Agent enabled, public-page reading may use the third-party Jina Reader service. The target URL, including its query parameters, is sent to that service. Do not submit URLs containing private tokens, internal documents, or signed download credentials. Search queries are also sent to the selected search service.

- Original research documents stay on the local machine. The model receives only passages selected by server-side search.
- Keys for the backend's default provider come only from environment variables and are not written to product configuration or the repository.
- An API key entered in the browser persists in that browser profile's local `localStorage`; it is not an OS keychain and encryption is not guaranteed. It is sent through the local backend to the selected model provider only when used and is not written to backend configuration or logs.
- Ordinary chat does not call tools. With Agent enabled, chat can use product-provided web and research tools. Bounded tasks such as document extraction retain task-specific execution restrictions.
- Document citations use `[资料:<id> p.<page>]`. Missing, incorrect, or unknown citations are rejected by code.
- Research-stage agents have no network access. The orchestrator fetches data through controlled scripts and stores
  raw responses with hashes.
- The local API binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Write requests require authentication and JSON.
- Output is limited to data, analytical frameworks, scenario probabilities, and decision checkpoints. It does not
  provide position, sizing, target-price, or stop-loss instructions.

## Development and tests

```bash
npm run typecheck --prefix orchestrator
npm test --prefix orchestrator

npm run typecheck --prefix desktop
npm test --prefix desktop
npm run build --prefix desktop

.venv/bin/python -m pytest calc/tests -q
.venv/bin/python -m pytest backtest/tests -q
.venv/bin/python -m pytest .agents/skills/data-access/scripts/tests -q
```

Latest local acceptance checks (September 7, 2026, M40; documentation edits do not change the scope of these checks):

- orchestrator: serial runs on Node 22 and Node 26 each reported **851 tests: 850 passed, one Windows-only ACL test skipped**; typecheck passed. Historical concurrent-test wait timeouts remain disclosed rather than erased by the serial result.
- desktop: **82/82**, with typecheck and production build passing; Python (calculation library, backtest, and data scripts): **754/754**.
- Mac: signing-tool tests **4/4**, native-window checks **21/21**; the installed final M40 app passed signature, ticket, and Gatekeeper checks, plus live tool use and restart recovery.
- Current evidence and limits are recorded in [M40 release and privacy validation](docs/发布候选与隐私验收_M40_2026-09-07.md) (Chinese). A successful core-scope six-stage run does not prove full-scope research, every data source, or every model works.
- Incremental fixes passed independent audits. Neither test counts nor Apple notarization prove exhaustive correctness or release readiness on every platform.

Project rule: test each completed component, run an independent Codex review, verify every finding, fix valid issues,
and re-review. A component is not described as complete and is not committed or pushed before that loop closes.

## Current boundaries

- This release includes source code, a browser UI, and an Apple Silicon Mac installer. The app is signed and notarized; the DMG is signed. There is no validated Windows EXE or Intel Mac installer.
- MiMo API has passed an end-to-end run from an empty configuration to a real business report. Other third-party
  providers still require the user's own keys and are not marked verified without real compatibility-matrix runs.
- Native Windows 11 support includes PowerShell setup/start scripts, Windows path and process handling, and the
  controlled research toolchain. CI configuration includes `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`, and `ubuntu-latest`;
  Windows runs selected cross-platform contract tests, not the entire backend suite. Physical Windows hardware and a Job Object guarantee for child-process cleanup after normal exit have not been validated.
  Windows 10 is best-effort, following upstream Codex support.
- Mac notarization validates distribution signing and Apple's security checks, not first installation on another clean Mac, every provider, or every external data source. A registered endpoint is not a guarantee of third-party uptime.
